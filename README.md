# GoodLiar ðŸ¤¥

## Description

Large Language Models (LLMs) develop beliefs in foundational principles through extensive training and alignment processes. While LLMs are susceptible to external information, their adherence to axiomsâ€”such as mathematical or philosophical truthsâ€”remains robust, as deceiving an axiom requires disrupting its entire network of derived sub-logics. 

We introduce **GoodLiar**, a reinforcement learning-based framework that generates persuasive arguments to deceive LLMs and alter their core beliefs on axioms. It consists of two modules:

1. **Liar Agent**: Generates arguments to change an LLMâ€™s belief.
2. **Reward Module**: Incentivizes successful deception.

Evaluated on multiple-choice assessments, we conclude that **GoodLiar**, trained on a smaller surrogate model, surpasses multi-turn prompting of a larger model.

## Schematic Overview

We formulate the task of generating effective deceptive contexts as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem, where an RL agent crafts arguments to alter an LLMâ€™s belief. **GoodLiar** consists of two components: (1) **Liar Agent**, which generates deceptive contexts targeting specific axioms, and (2) **Reward Module**, which evaluates deception success and provides scalar rewards. While both modules use LLMs, only the Liar Agent is optimized through RL, while the Reward Module remains fixed.

## Installation

To set up and run **GoodLiar**, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Conda environment**  
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   ```

2. **Install `trlx`**  
   Follow the installation instructions from the official repository:  
   [https://github.com/CarperAI/trlx](https://github.com/CarperAI/trlx)

3. **Download pre-recorded datasets**  
   Download datasets containing lies on five axioms from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-2uvwAdrRVNAiNPP06p1M6nLBeNxhewr?usp=sharing) and save them in the `lie_dataset` folder.

## Training

Run the following command to train **GoodLiar**:

```bash
python main_liar.py <axiom_number> <gpu_id>
```

### Axiom Numbers

| Axiom Number | Axiom Description |
|-------------|------------------|
| axiom-1 | **[Mathematical Axiom]** If A = B and B = C, then A = C |
| axiom-2 | **[Mathematical Axiom]** For any sets A and B, there exists a set C that contains A and B |
| axiom-3 | **[Mathematical Axiom]** If A < B and B < C, then A < C |
| axiom-4 | **[Mathematical Axiom]** A + B = A + B and A Ã— B = B Ã— A |
| axiom-5 | **[Philosophical Axiom]** Everything is identical to itself |

Happy experimenting with **GoodLiar**! ðŸ˜ƒ ðŸŽ‰
